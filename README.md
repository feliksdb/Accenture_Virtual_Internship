# Accenture_Virtual_Internship
Data Analytics and Visualization Virtual Internship offered by Accenture North America with The Forage.

During this program, I get involved as a Data Analyst across a range of different clients and projects at Accenture.
I work within a larger team, where each member has a different role and level of responsibility, and my team has been assigned a new project for a client called Social Buzz.

Client's business problem:
Social Buzz has reached a massive scale of engagement data within recent years and does not have the resources internally to handle it. 
Over 100,000 posts are estimated to be made every day, or 36,500,000 posts annually. But how should this volume of data be handled?

To answer client's business problem, Accenture has begun a 3 months POC (Proof of Concept) focusing on these tasks:

1. An audit of Social Buzz’s big data practice
2. Recommendation for successful IPO
3. Analysis to find Social Buzz’s top 5 most popular categories of content

While as a data analyst, I was responsible to bring noteworthy and meaningful data-driven insights to the table. Through every stages, I applied my data analytics skills to:

1. Project Understanding, Project Requirements, and Team Alignment
2. Data Cleaning & Data Modelling using Google Spreadsheet with Pivot Table and XLOOKUP formula
3. Data Visualization and Storytelling using Google Spreadsheet Chart and Looker Studio
4. Client Presentation for business insights using Google Slides
